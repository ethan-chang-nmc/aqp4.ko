These scripts were used to analyze the fluorescent tracer across vascular images taken of coronal mouse brain sections. 

- peak_baseline_graphclick.m: loads data as a graph to have the user manually identify the peak and baseline
- peaktobase_exl_exporter.m: exports data in proper format as an excel file
- confocal_analyze.m: loads data and calculates needed variables
- hf_bl_df_checker.m: checks half-fluorescence and compares it to decay fluorescence
